#### Problem statement
Big data requires a lot of computing. Computer clusters and video cards can perform
many calculations in parallel. But that requires that your computing task actually
allows data to be processed in parallel. In this assignment you will use Nextflow to
calculate LogP values for molecules encoded as SMILES that you retrieved from
Wikidata.
